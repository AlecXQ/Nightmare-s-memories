# Nightmare's memories - Game

This little project was made with basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript, aplying flex box concepts and 3D concepts.

The game is about a classic dynamic of seeking for the cards' pairs, where if you find any pair those cards will be blocked until the end of the game.

- The design has dark and strong colors with a tarot thematic in the images.

There are many possible changes such as storing the scores, showing any message or action after you win the match, adding a sing in formulary, etc. So I'll be working on it

# Here you can try it by yourself, just do it!
